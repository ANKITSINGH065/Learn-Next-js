Certainly! In Next.js, creating a custom 404 error page involves creating a file named `404.js` in the `/pages` directory. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create the 404 Page:**

   In the `/pages` directory, create a file named `404.js`. This file will serve as your custom 404 error page.

   ```jsx
   // pages/404.js
   const Custom404 = () => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
         <p>Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Custom404;
   ```

2. **Customize the 404 Page:**

   Customize the content of the `404.js` file according to your design and the message you want to display when a user encounters a 404 error.

3. **Test the 404 Page:**

   Start or restart your Next.js development server, and navigate to a non-existent route to test the custom 404 page. You should see your custom 404 error message.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and visit a non-existent route, such as `http://localhost:3000/nonexistent-page`.

Now, whenever a user tries to access a page that doesn't exist in your Next.js application, they will be redirected to the custom 404 error page you've created. Customize the content and styling of the `404.js` file to fit the design and messaging of your application.
