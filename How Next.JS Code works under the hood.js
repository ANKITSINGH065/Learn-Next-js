Next.js, as a React framework, works by providing a layer of abstraction on top of React to simplify common tasks and improve performance. Let's explore some key aspects of how Next.js code works under the hood:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**
   - One of the core features of Next.js is Server-Side Rendering. When a user requests a page, Next.js can render the React components on the server and send the fully-rendered HTML to the client. This is achieved through functions like `getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps` (deprecated in favor of `getServerSideProps`).

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG):**
   - Next.js supports Static Site Generation, where pages are generated at build time. This is beneficial for pages that don't need to fetch data dynamically on each request. The `getStaticProps` function allows you to fetch data at build time.

3. **File-Based Routing:**
   - Next.js leverages a file-based routing system. When you create a new file inside the `/pages` directory, it automatically becomes a route in your application. This convention simplifies routing and eliminates the need for a separate routing configuration.

4. **Automatic Code Splitting:**
   - Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks. When a user accesses a particular page, only the necessary JavaScript code for that page is loaded. This improves initial page load times and contributes to a better user experience.

5. **Server and Client-Side Rendering Hybrid:**
   - Next.js allows you to use a hybrid rendering approach. Some parts of the page can be statically generated, while others can be server-rendered or rendered on the client side. This flexibility is achieved through a combination of different rendering functions (`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and client-side rendering with React hooks).

6. **Middleware Support:**
   - Next.js supports middleware, which are functions that can be executed before handling a request. Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, or modifying the request/response objects.

7. **API Routes:**
   - The `/pages/api` directory allows you to create API routes easily. Each file in this directory becomes an API endpoint. This is particularly useful for building backend functionality within your Next.js application.

8. **Webpack Integration:**
   - Next.js uses Webpack under the hood for bundling and optimizing your code. It comes with sensible defaults, but you can also customize the webpack configuration by using the `next.config.js` file.

9. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):**
   - During development, Next.js utilizes Hot Module Replacement to update modules in the browser without a full page reload. This speeds up the development process by allowing you to see changes instantly.

10. **Client-Side Navigation:**
    - Next.js includes a client-side navigation system that enhances the user experience by minimizing full-page reloads. The `Link` component is commonly used for client-side navigation.

In summary, Next.js simplifies the process of building React applications by providing a set of conventions, tools, and features that enhance development efficiency and performance. The framework combines server-side rendering, static site generation, automatic code splitting, and other optimizations to deliver a seamless development experience and a fast, responsive user interface.
